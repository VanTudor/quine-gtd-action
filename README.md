# Set up

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with repo: all and org: read scopes
- A forked GTD repo
- 

### Generating a PAT:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens.
2. Generate a new token. Name it `QUINE_GH_PAT`. We need the `repo:all` and `read:org` scopes.

3. Copy it and keep it for the next step. Note: it won't be available after close the tab.

**Q:** Why do you need a PAT? Couldn't you just use the default GitHub token?

**A:** We need read/write access to the repo's secrets in order to store the access tokens to Quine's API. Unfortunately, 
   you can't edit repository secrets using the default GitHub token supplied to Actions.

### Adding your PAT to GTD:
1. Go to `https://github.com/${YOUR_USERNAME}/gtd/settings/secrets/actions`.
2. Add a new secret. Name it `QUINE_GH_PAT` and paste the PAT generated in the previous step.

## Setting up the action in GTD's Porter workflow
1. In your private fork of GTD, open `gtd/.github/workflows/porter.yml` 
2. Create a new job step with the following parameters:
- `run-cron`: Cron pattern according to which the action runs.
 - E.g. `* * * * 1` runs the action every Monday (first day of the week). See https://crontab.guru/, if you need help with crons.
 - Notes:
    - Only the month, week and day parameters are taken into account, because this time pattern is dependant
      on the parent workflow cron.
    - We assumes this value to be a subset of the parent workflow's cron. I.e. if the workflow's cron instructs
     GitHub to run the cron on every Tuesday, but this action is set to run on a daily basis, **the action will
      only run on Tuesdays**.
- `gh-pat`: Name (key) of the secret you stored in your private fork of **GTD**'s secret page 
- `quine-access-token`: Access token used to authentify against Quine's API. This is completely managed by the action, 
  its name is hardcoded inside the action's code and its value in the .yml should always be `${{ secrets.QUINE_ACCESS_TOKEN}}`
- `quine-refresh-token`: Same as `quine-access-token`. It is also hardcoded and its value should always be `${{ secrets.QUINE_REFRESH_TOKEN}}`
### Working job config example (just copy-paste):
This runs on every Monday.
```
- uses: quine.sh/quine-gtd-action@master
  id: quineGTD
  with:
    run-cron: "* * * * 1"
    gh-pat: ${{ secrets.QUINE_GH_PAT }}
    quine-access-token: ${{ secrets.QUINE_ACCESS_TOKEN}}
    quine-refresh-token: ${{ secrets.QUINE_REFRESH_TOKEN}}
```

### Full working example of working porter.yml (just copy-paste):
```
name: Porter
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ^^ so you can run this workflow manually if you need to
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'
    # ^^ change this so it occurs while youâ€™re sleeping (the timezone is UTC)
    # Syntax reference: https://crontab.guru

## First run
The first time you run the workflow, you'll have to log in or sign up for a Quine account. Fortunately,
it's a one time thing. To do so:  
1. Go to `https://github.com/${YOUR_USERNAME}/gtd/actions/workflows/porter.yml` and run your workflow.
2. Wait for Quine's GTD action to run. You should see a message similar to this:
-- image here
3. Click on the link and log in or sign up on our platform.
4. That's it! Come back to your issues page and check out our recommended repos.

Note: we do use a refresh token to renew your access to our API, but it 
will go stale if not used for an extended period of time, in which case your
workflow will fail. To renew it, just go through the authentication steps again (the links
should pop up in your Actions console).
